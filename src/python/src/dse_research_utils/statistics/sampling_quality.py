"""One correct way to read sampling-quality signals off a trace.

Every gate and every ad-hoc script needs the same four numbers — max R-hat, min ESS,
min per-chain BFMI, total divergences — and each one that re-derives them can get them
subtly wrong. Two traps, both observed in the consuming repositories:

**Rounding.** ``az.summary()`` rounds to ``rcParams["stats.round_to"]`` (``"2g"`` — two
significant figures) unless passed ``round_to="none"``, *the string*. ``round_to=None``
and ``"auto"`` both fall through to the rounded default. ArviZ 1.2 returned a
string-dtype frame when the argument was omitted; ArviZ 1.3 returns numeric columns,
but still applies the rounded default. Rounding erases exactly the digits the gate turns
on: across the whole gate-relevant range every
R-hat from 1.011 to 1.049 rounds to ``1.0`` and clears an ``R-hat <= 1.01`` test it
should fail (dseinternational/research#65).

**Coercion.** ``trace.sample_stats["diverging"]`` is an xarray ``DataArray``; reduce it
via ``np.asarray(....values).sum()`` rather than relying on ``DataArray.__int__``, and
take BFMI from :func:`dse_research_utils.statistics.diagnostics._bfmi_per_chain`, since
``az.bfmi`` returns a ``DataTree`` in ArviZ 1.x that cannot be coerced to an array.

This module extracts the numbers and nothing else. It deliberately does **not** decide
whether a fit passed: the call sites differ in which variables they gate over and in how
they treat a missing BFMI, and those policies stay where they are rather than being
silently homogenised here.

    ----------
    trace
        An ArviZ ``InferenceData`` (or DataTree-backed equivalent) with a ``posterior``

    -------
    SamplingQuality

        tolerate a failed diagnostic calculation should catch them and decide what an
